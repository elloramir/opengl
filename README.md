# Elloramir OpenGL
This is the result of everything I am studying and will study.

### Remarks ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- The project and build script are designed for **Windows** only, if you really want to compile on linux, good luck!
- For Windows users, just GLFW are not header only lib there. You need to make it accessible for the compiler.
