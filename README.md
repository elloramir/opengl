# Elloramir OpenGL
This is the result of everything I am studying and will study.

### Remarks ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- The project and build script are designed for **Windows** only, if you really want to compile on linux, good luck!
- For Windows users, just GLFW and GLEW are not header only lib there. You need to make them accessible for the compiler.

### Study map
- [x] GLFW window and OpenGL loading with GLEW
- [x] VAO, VBO, IBO/EBO
- [x] Shaders
- [x] Model, view and projection (MVP)
- [x] Camera
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] Model loading
- [ ] ...
